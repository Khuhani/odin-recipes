    <h2>Kaimati-Fried Sweet Dumplings</h2>
    <p>Kaimatis are an indulgent Kenyan Coast specialty where by, gooey dough balls are coated with sensational syrup. In addition to tasting heavenly, they are also extremely easy to make.</p>
    <p>In many Households, these delicacies are mostly prepared during the Holy Month of Ramadhan as a dessert or a delightful snack, but they can also be found on the humid streets of the Kenyan Coast as street food anytime of the year…</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup natural plain yoghurt</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>Grated lemon rids (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
<li>In a mixing bowl, add all ingredients and mix very well till the batter becomes sticky</li>
<li>Cover and set aside for 1-2 hours to puff up (can also leave it aside overnight)</li>
<li>In the meantime, prepare the syrup by;

    Adding sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and add lemon juice (grated lemon rinds) and cardamom then simmer for about 5-8 minutes or till it’s sticky. The syrup should coat a spoon when ready</li>
<li>Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely</li>
<li>In a wok, heat 2 cups of vegetable oil and using a small ice cream scoop or a spoon, drop dumplings in the hot oil and fry till golden brown</li>
<li>Drop in the ready dumplings in the syrup and coat them for one minute (the longer you leave them the more syrup they’ll absolve hence becoming very sweet)</li>
<li>Another way of enjoying kaimatis is by coating them with powdered sugar

    or with melted chocolate</li>
    </ol>
