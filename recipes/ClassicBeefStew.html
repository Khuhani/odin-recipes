        <li>In a saucepan, place meat, ginger, garlic and 1 cup of water. Boil the meat for roughly 30 minutes on medium heat</li>
        <li>Separate meat from broth and set aside (you’ll need the broth later for the stew)</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, heat vegetable oil on medium heat, fry onions till soft. Add beef and fry till it starts to brown. Add tomatoes and tomato paste and cook till the fresh tomatoes have softened. Add the spices; curry powder and paprika and mix well. Let the mixture simmer for a minute or two for the spices to mix well with the beef.</li>
        <li>Add carrots and potatoes and stir well, again let the mixture simmer about five minutes stirring each minute to avoid sticking in the pan. Once everything has mixed in well add the broth you had set aside earlier.
