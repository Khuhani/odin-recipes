<p>Samosa is a triangular-shape savory pastry fried in oil, containing spiced vegetables, ground beef/lamb, ground chicken or fish. In the Kenyan Cuisine, samosas are considered as exotic snacks of all times. Below is a simple recipe for ground beef samosas which are my favorites!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg ground beef</li>
    <li>¼kg fresh or frozen green peas</li>
    <li>2 red onions, finely chopped</li>
    <li>5 cloves of garlic, grated</li>
    <li>1-inch fresh ginger, grated</li>
    <li>1 fresh green chilli, finely chopped (Optional)…</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon of turmeric</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 bunch of fresh coriander, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>Juice of ½ a lemon (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a small mixing bowl, mix ½ a cup of flour with a little water and make a thick flour paste to serve as a “glue” for sealing samosa pockets</li>
<li>Fold all samosa pockets first in a cone shape before filling them with the cooled meat. Use a small ice cream scoop or a tablespoon to fill the samosa pockets (Do not overfill them)</li>
<li>Seal using the “glue” you prepared (Seal them very well otherwise they’ll open up when frying!)</li>
<li>Filled and sealed samosa pockets can be stored in the refrigerator and be deep fried the next day or one can also deep freeze them  as desired</li>
<li>Heat up oil in a deep frying pan or Wok</li>
<li>Test  your oil by gently dropping a small piece of dough into the oil. If the dough stays at the bottom for a couple of seconds then rises to the surface then your oil is ready for frying but if it rises up immediately after dropping it into the oil, then your oil is too hot and you need to reduce the heat. Too hot oil will only cook the outside and the inside will be uncooked especially if the samosas were frozen</li>
<li>Deep fry samosa till golden brown on both sides and crispy, use a kitchen paper or a clean towel to drain off any excess oil</li>
<li>Serve hot or cold accompanied by a chutney of any kind or a piece of fresh lime</li>
</ol>
