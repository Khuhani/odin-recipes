Project: A HTML page on my favorite recipes

Aim: The aim of this project is to test my HTML knacks. Ideally, the project should be ongoing for me to add style{CSS} and interactivity{Js} in the future as I gain more knowledge and review my past work to add important updates. 

The project will also help me assess my Git and Github skills.
